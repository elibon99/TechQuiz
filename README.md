### Description

TechQuiz is an online quiz game that allows people to compete against each other on
technological questions. Every game consists of sets of quizzes where each player receives ten
points per correct answered question. When all sets are played the player with the highest score
wins. If the scores are equal the game is ended as a draw.
TechQuiz also allows players to compete against themselves and test their knowledge in
technological topics. Depending on how quick they answer, they receive higher scores that allow
them to climb in the leaderboard.
